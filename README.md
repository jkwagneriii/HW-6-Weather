## Description
When you load the webpage, there will be a form available to enter the value of a city name. Once you press the search button, it the application will fetch weather data from a third party server. There will be an up to date current weather display, as well as a 5 day forecast. Each time you select a new city, the city you were just viewing will be added to the page as a button that you can recall again later. 

This is a homework assignment for the Northwestern University Coding Program. It involves using third party API's to gather data and display that data on a webpage.

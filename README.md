# HW-6-Weather
This is a homework assignment for the Northwestern University Coding Program. It involves using third party API's to gather data and display that data on a webpage.

When you load the webpage, there will be a form available to enter the value of a city name. Once you press the search button, it the application will fetch weather data from a third party server. There will be an up to date current weather display, as well as a 5 day forcast. Each time you select a new city, the city you were just viewing will be added to the page as a button that you can recall again later. 

Jquery and JavaScript are finally starting to make a litte bit more sense. The blank page is still incredibly intimidating, but the building blocks are becoming more clear. I can identify the sections of code that would make more sense as a function and I'm still working on how to fully execute that. This felt much dryer than my previous assignments, but I know it still has a long way to go. I'm trying to use console.log more to understand where I am it within my logic and I see why it is such a useful device. 

Moving forward I hope to start seeing the broken down steps of a webpage's logic more easily. I'm still struggling to slow my thought process down to the rate of the computer and I believe that is why starting each assignment is always the most daunting part for me.

//First I need to create the divs for each section of weather information. There will be a header at the top of the page that doesn't need any sort of interaction. My first goal will be to get a single location to show the current weather. Then I'll move on to having the 5-Day forcast display. THEN I'll work on the city search bar and how that interacts with the weather being displayed. 






//By city name
// You can search weather forecast for 5 days with data every 3 hours by city name. All weather data can be obtained in JSON and XML formats.
// api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?q={city name}&appid={API key}

// Call current UV data By geographic coordinates
// ("http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/uvi?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API key}")
